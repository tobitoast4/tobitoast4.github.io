                  <h5>Cookies</h5>
                  <div>
                      Cookies are files with a small amount of data that are commonly used as anonymous unique identifiers. These are sent to your browser from the websites that you visit and are stored on your device's
                      internal memory.

                      This Service does not use these “cookies” explicitly. However, the app may use third party code and libraries that use “cookies” to collect information and improve their services.
                      You have the option to either accept or refuse these
                      cookies and know when a cookie is being sent to your device. If you choose to refuse our cookies, you may not be able to use some portions of this Service.

                  <h5>Service Providers</h5>
                  <div>
                      I may employ third-party companies and individuals due to the following reasons:

                      <ul>
                          <li>To facilitate our Service;</li>

                      I want to inform users of this Service that these third parties have access to your Personal Information.
                      The reason is to perform the tasks assigned to them on our behalf. However, they are obligated
                      not to disclose or use the information for any other purpose.

                      that no method of transmission over the internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure and reliable, and I cannot guarantee its absolute security.

                  <div>
                      These Services do not address anyone under the age of 13. I do not knowingly collect personally identifiable information from children under 13 years of age.
                      In the case I discover that a child under 13 has provided me with personal information,
                      I immediately delete this from our servers. If you are a parent or guardian and you are aware that your child has provided us with personal information, please
